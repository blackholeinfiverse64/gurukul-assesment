# Database Setup Guide for Assignment System

## Critical Issues Fixed

This guide addresses the critical errors encountered in the assignment evaluation system:

1. **Supabase RLS Policy Error** - Fixed with proper Row Level Security policies
2. **Missing Import Error** - Fixed CLERK_ENABLED import in AssignmentResults component
3. **Component Error Boundary** - Added error boundary to prevent crashes

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Fix Missing Import (COMPLETED)
The `CLERK_ENABLED` import has been added to `AssignmentResults.jsx`.

### 2. Run SQL Script to Fix RLS Policies

**IMPORTANT**: Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of src/sql/fix_rls_policies.sql
-- This will create proper RLS policies for authenticated users
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire contents of `src/sql/fix_rls_policies.sql`
4. Paste and run the script
5. Verify the policies were created successfully

### 3. Verify Database Structure

The script creates these tables with proper RLS policies:

- **students** - User profile information linked to Clerk user IDs
- **assignment_attempts** - Complete assignment attempt data
- **assignment_responses** - Question-by-question response details

### 4. Test Database Connection

Use the Admin Panel → Database Test to verify:
1. Database connection works
2. All tables are accessible
3. RLS policies allow data insertion
4. Foreign key relationships work

## RLS Policy Details

The script creates these policies:

### Students Table
- `Users can view their own student record`
- `Users can insert their own student record`
- `Users can update their own student record`

### Assignment Attempts Table
- `Users can view their own assignment attempts`
- `Users can insert their own assignment attempts`
- `Users can update their own assignment attempts`

### Assignment Responses Table
- `Users can view their own assignment responses`
- `Users can insert their own assignment responses`

## Authentication Requirements

The system requires:
1. **Clerk Authentication** - Users must be logged in
2. **Supabase Auth Integration** - Clerk user ID must match Supabase auth.uid()
3. **Proper RLS Policies** - Allow users to access only their own data

## Error Handling Improvements

### 1. Error Boundary
- Wraps AssignmentResults component
- Prevents crashes from breaking the entire flow
- Provides user-friendly error messages

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages
- Specific messages for RLS policy errors
- Permission denied errors
- Missing table errors
- Database connection issues

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- Assignment evaluation continues even if storage fails
- Users see their results regardless of database issues
- Clear feedback about what succeeded and what failed

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Complete Assignment Flow
1. Go to `/dashboard` and start an assignment
2. Complete all questions with answers and explanations
3. Submit the assignment
4. Verify evaluation completes successfully
5. Check that results are displayed properly
6. Verify data is saved to database (check Admin → Database Test)

### 2. Admin Panel Tests
1. Go to `/admin` and login
2. Run "Database Test" to verify table structure
3. Run "Evaluation Test" to verify AI evaluation works
4. Check for any remaining errors

### 3. User Progress Tracking
1. Complete multiple assignments
2. Go to `/dashboard` to see User Progress section
3. Verify assignment history is displayed
4. Check statistics and improvement tracking

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "new row violates row-level security policy"
**Solution**: Run the RLS policy SQL script in Supabase

### Issue: "CLERK_ENABLED is not defined"
**Solution**: Already fixed - import added to AssignmentResults.jsx

### Issue: "relation does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the table creation part of the SQL script

### Issue: Component crashes on results page
**Solution**: Already fixed - ErrorBoundary added

### Issue: Permission denied for table
**Solution**: Verify Supabase project settings and RLS policies

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] SQL script executed successfully in Supabase
- [ ] Database Test passes in Admin Panel
- [ ] Assignment can be completed end-to-end
- [ ] Results display properly with user information
- [ ] Assignment data is saved to database
- [ ] User progress tracking works
- [ ] No console errors during assignment flow

## Support

If issues persist after following this guide:

1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify Supabase project configuration
3. Ensure Clerk authentication is working properly
4. Run the Database Test in Admin Panel for diagnostics
5. Check that the SQL script executed without errors

The system now includes comprehensive error handling and should work reliably even if some components fail.
